# Client-Server Communication â€” **TCP/UDP**

## Overview
TCP (Transmission Control Protocol) and UDP (User Datagram Protocol) are two core communication protocols that operate at the transport layer of the OSI model. TCP provides a reliable, connection-oriented data transmission method, while UDP offers a faster, connectionless approach suitable for time-sensitive applications. Mastering TCP and UDP is essential for building networked applications that require efficient and reliable data transmission.

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At this level, engineers understand the basics of TCP and UDP and can explain their key differences.

- **TCP vs. UDP:** Basic understanding of the differences between TCP (reliable, connection-oriented) and UDP (unreliable, connectionless).
- **Ports and Sockets:** Familiarity with the concept of ports and sockets and how they enable communication between devices on a network.
- **Basic Connection Flow:** Understanding the TCP three-way handshake (SYN, SYN-ACK, ACK) and basic UDP data packet transmission.

#### Skills
Engineers can explain TCP and UDP's fundamental differences and describe the basic concepts of ports, sockets, and connection establishment.

### ðŸŒ¿ Intermediate
At this level, engineers can work with TCP and UDP sockets and handle basic network programming.

- **Socket Programming Basics:** Ability to create TCP and UDP sockets to send and receive data between client and server applications.
- **Connection Management:** Understanding of TCP connection states (e.g., SYN-SENT, ESTABLISHED, FIN-WAIT) and how connections are closed gracefully.
- **Packet Loss and Retransmission:** Knowledge of how TCP manages packet loss with retransmission mechanisms, while UDP operates without guarantees of delivery.

#### Skills
Engineers can set up basic socket connections, manage TCP and UDP data transmission, and explain TCPâ€™s reliability features and UDPâ€™s trade-offs for speed.

### ðŸŒ³ Advanced
At this advanced level, engineers are proficient in optimizing TCP/UDP connections and handling complex network configurations.

- **TCP Congestion Control:** Knowledge of TCP congestion control mechanisms (e.g., slow start, congestion avoidance) to optimize network performance.
- **Streaming and Real-Time Data with UDP:** Experience using UDP for real-time applications (e.g., video streaming, online gaming), where low latency is prioritized over reliability.
- **Error Detection and Correction:** Familiarity with techniques for error detection and correction in network communications, such as checksums and acknowledgments.

#### Skills
Engineers can optimize TCP connections for performance, manage real-time data using UDP, and implement error-handling mechanisms in networked applications.
