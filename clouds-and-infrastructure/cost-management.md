# Clouds and Infrastructure â€” **Cost Management and Optimization**

## Overview
Cost Management and Optimization in cloud environments involves monitoring, controlling, and reducing cloud expenses while maximizing resource efficiency. Engineers must understand cost structures, optimize resource usage, and use automation to manage costs proactively. Mastery of cost optimization ensures sustainable growth by aligning infrastructure expenses with business goals.
