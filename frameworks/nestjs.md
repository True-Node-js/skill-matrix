# Node.js Frameworks â€” **NestJS**

## Overview
NestJS is a progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable, and scalable server-side applications. Built with TypeScript, NestJS uses a modular architecture inspired by Angular, making it well-suited for creating complex applications that are easy to maintain and extend. It includes features such as dependency injection, decorators, and built-in support for various transport layers, enabling developers to build modern, structured, and feature-rich backend solutions.

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At this level, engineers are familiar with the basics of NestJS and can set up a simple application structure with fundamental modules, controllers, and services.

- **Project Initialization:** Setting up a basic NestJS project using the CLI (`nest new project-name`), generating a project with a structured layout.
- **Modules, Controllers, and Services:** Understanding the core building blocks of NestJS applicationsâ€”modules for organization, controllers for handling requests, and services for business logic.
- **Dependency Injection Basics:** Utilizing NestJSâ€™s dependency injection system to inject services into controllers and other services for code modularity and reusability.

#### Skills
Engineers can set up a basic NestJS application, organize code into modules, and use controllers and services to manage routes and business logic.

### ðŸŒ¿ Intermediate
At this level, engineers have gained proficiency in NestJS, allowing them to work with more complex application structures and integrate middleware and guards.

- **Middleware and Interceptors:** Configuring middleware for request handling and using interceptors to modify or transform responses, providing more control over the request-response cycle.
- **Guards and Authorization:** Implementing guards to manage authorization and role-based access control in routes, ensuring secure access to protected resources.
- **Pipes for Validation and Transformation:** Using pipes to validate incoming requests and transform data, leveraging the built-in `ValidationPipe` with class-validator for request validation.

#### Skills
Engineers can build more secure and structured applications, integrating middleware, guards, and pipes to enforce rules and manage request handling effectively.

### ðŸŒ³ Advanced
At this advanced level, engineers understand NestJS deeply and can leverage it to build high-performance, scalable applications.

- **Microservices with NestJS:** Designing microservices architectures with NestJS, using its built-in support for various transport layers such as Redis, RabbitMQ, and gRPC to enable efficient inter-service communication.
- **Database Integration with TypeORM or Mongoose:** Configuring NestJS applications with database integrations like TypeORM (SQL databases) or Mongoose (MongoDB) for data persistence, including setting up models, repositories, and custom queries.
- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Utilizing NestJSâ€™s event emitter and external messaging systems (like Kafka or AWS SNS) to build event-driven architectures, handling asynchronous workflows for enhanced performance and scalability.

#### Skills
Engineers can create highly scalable applications, designing with microservices, event-driven architectures, and efficient database integration, suitable for production environments.

### ðŸš€ Expert
An expert in NestJS can architect complex, enterprise-level systems with advanced integrations, leveraging cloud services and custom modules for optimized and maintainable applications.

- **Scalability with Cloud Integrations:** Deploying and scaling NestJS applications using AWS services, such as AWS Lambda (for serverless functions), AWS ECS or EKS for container orchestration, and AWS RDS or DynamoDB for database management.
- **Custom Decorators and Advanced Dependency Injection:** Creating custom decorators and leveraging advanced dependency injection techniques to add flexible, reusable functionality throughout the application.
- **GraphQL Integration with NestJS:** Building modern APIs using GraphQL and NestJSâ€™s dedicated GraphQL module, enabling efficient querying and fetching of data while maintaining strong type safety with TypeScript.

#### Skills
Engineers can architect enterprise-grade applications using NestJS, integrating with cloud infrastructure and implementing custom, scalable solutions that ensure security, maintainability, and optimal performance.
