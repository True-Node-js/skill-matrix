# System Design â€” **Data Consistency and Distributed Systems**

## Overview
Data consistency and distributed systems are key to building resilient, scalable applications that operate across multiple nodes or regions. Ensuring consistency in distributed systems involves managing data replication, handling network partitions, and understanding trade-offs between consistency, availability, and partition tolerance. Mastery of these concepts enables engineers to build systems that maintain reliable data integrity and performance at scale.
