# System Design â€” **Event-Driven Architecture and Messaging**

## Overview
Event-driven architecture (EDA) and messaging systems allow applications to react to changes in real-time by decoupling services and handling asynchronous communication. EDA enhances scalability and flexibility, allowing services to communicate through event brokers like Kafka or RabbitMQ. Mastery of EDA enables engineers to build responsive, resilient systems that can handle complex workflows and high data throughput.
