# Node.js Core â€” **Stream**

## Overview
The Stream module in Node.js allows engineers to work with streaming data efficiently, enabling the processing of large amounts of data without needing to load everything into memory. This is particularly useful for handling files, network communications, and other data sources that can produce data over time. Mastering streams is essential for building applications that require high performance and responsiveness, such as media streaming, real-time data processing, and large file uploads/downloads.

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At the novice level, the engineer becomes familiar with the basic concepts of streams, understanding their purpose and how to use the most common stream types in Node.js.

- **Readable Streams:** Ability to read data from a source incrementally, such as reading from a file or an HTTP response.
- **Writable Streams:** Understanding how to write data to a destination incrementally, such as writing to a file or sending data over a network.
- **Piping:** Basic usage of the `pipe()` method to connect readable and writable streams, allowing data to flow seamlessly from one to the other.

#### Skills
The engineer can create simple applications that utilize streams for reading and writing data, laying the foundation for more complex stream-based applications.
