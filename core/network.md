# Node.js Core â€” **Network**

## Overview
The Network module in Node.js enables engineers to build low-level networking applications, handling TCP, UDP, and DNS communications directly. It offers the tools to create custom servers and clients, making it essential for creating performant and scalable network-driven applications. Mastering the Network module allows engineers to handle a wide variety of networking tasks, including creating web servers, managing network connections, and optimizing data transfer processes.
