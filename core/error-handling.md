# Node.js Core â€” **Error Handling**

## Overview
Error handling is a critical component in building reliable applications in Node.js. The ability to anticipate, catch, and properly handle errors allows engineers to ensure that their applications remain resilient, even when unexpected issues occur. Node.js offers multiple mechanisms for handling errors, including traditional `try...catch` blocks, asynchronous error handling through callbacks and promises, and custom error classes for more robust control. Mastering error handling is crucial for building scalable and fault-tolerant applications.

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At this level, the engineer is introduced to basic error handling techniques in Node.js, focusing on fundamental approaches for catching and handling errors.

- **try...catch:** Understanding how to use the `try...catch` block to handle synchronous errors in a controlled manner.
- **Basic Error Object:** Familiarity with the default `Error` object in JavaScript, and how to create and throw basic error instances using `throw new Error(message)`.
- **Handling Errors in Callbacks:** Basic understanding of how to handle errors in callback functions by following the Node.js convention of passing errors as the first argument (`callback(error, result)`).

#### Skills
The engineer can handle basic synchronous errors and is familiar with callback-style error handling, ensuring minimal interruption in simple application workflows.

### ðŸŒ¿ Intermediate
At this stage, the engineer expands their error handling skills to handle asynchronous errors and work with modern error handling patterns in Node.js.

- **Promise Rejections:** Ability to handle errors in promises using `.catch()` for rejected promises, ensuring that asynchronous errors are caught and managed.
- **Async/Await Error Handling:** Understanding how to wrap asynchronous code in `try...catch` blocks when using async/await, simplifying error management in asynchronous flows.
- **Custom Error Classes:** Ability to create custom error classes by extending the built-in `Error` object, enabling more meaningful and application-specific error messages and types.

#### Skills
The engineer can handle both synchronous and asynchronous errors effectively, ensuring that all promise rejections and async errors are properly caught and logged.

---

### ðŸŒ³ Advanced
At this advanced stage, the engineer possesses a deep understanding of Node.js error handling and can implement more sophisticated strategies to ensure application resilience.

- **Global Error Handling:** Proficiency in managing global errors using `process.on('uncaughtException')` and `process.on('unhandledRejection')` to capture unhandled exceptions and promise rejections.
- **Error Logging and Monitoring:** Implementing comprehensive error logging solutions, such as using Winston or Morgan for logging, and integrating third-party services like Sentry to monitor and report runtime errors in production environments.
- **Graceful Shutdowns:** Ability to implement strategies for graceful shutdowns in the event of critical errors, ensuring that the application terminates safely while completing ongoing operations.

#### Skills
The engineer can design fault-tolerant systems that manage errors gracefully across the application lifecycle, from logging and monitoring to safe recovery and shutdown.

### ðŸš€ Expert
An expert in Node.js error handling possesses an in-depth understanding of advanced error management strategies and can build highly resilient systems that continue to operate under adverse conditions.

- **Advanced Error Propagation:** Expertise in designing custom error propagation strategies that allow for complex error chains to be passed through multiple layers of an application, maintaining contextual information at each level.
- **Error Handling in Microservices:** Knowledge of error handling in distributed systems, including microservices architectures, where errors must be propagated across network boundaries and handled across multiple services.
- **Circuit Breaker Patterns:** Experience implementing advanced fault tolerance mechanisms like circuit breaker patterns, preventing cascading failures by temporarily halting connections to failing services.

#### Skills
The engineer can design and implement sophisticated error-handling frameworks, ensuring that distributed systems or microservices-based architectures remain stable, scalable, and fault-tolerant even in the face of unexpected errors.
