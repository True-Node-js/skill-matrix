# Node.js Core â€” **Debugging**

## Overview
Debugging is an essential skill for identifying and fixing issues in Node.js applications. Node.js provides a variety of tools and techniques for efficiently debugging code, allowing engineers to track down bugs, analyze memory usage, and profile performance. Effective debugging helps engineers maintain code quality, ensure stability, and optimize application performance. Mastering Node.js debugging tools is critical for building reliable and scalable applications.

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At the novice level, the engineer learns basic debugging techniques to identify and resolve issues in their Node.js applications.

- **`console.log` Debugging:** Using `console.log()` to output variable values and execution states at various points in the code, providing visibility into application behavior.
- **Error Stack Traces:** Understanding how to read stack traces that accompany errors, helping to locate where errors are occurring in the code.
- **Node.js Debugger Basics:** Familiarity with the built-in Node.js debugger using the `node inspect` command to step through code and analyze its execution line by line.

#### Skills
The engineer can use basic debugging techniques like `console.log()` and stack traces to troubleshoot and resolve simple bugs in their applications.

### ðŸŒ¿ Intermediate
At this stage, the engineer adopts more advanced debugging techniques and tools, improving their ability to debug asynchronous and more complex applications.

- **Using Breakpoints in VSCode:** Familiarity with using breakpoints in IDEs like Visual Studio Code, allowing for interactive debugging, stepping through code, and inspecting variables at runtime.
- **Debugging Asynchronous Code:** Ability to debug asynchronous code using the Node.js inspector or IDE tools to handle callbacks, promises, and async/await issues.
- **Memory Usage and Profiling:** Introduction to memory profiling tools, such as `--inspect` or Chrome DevTools, to monitor memory usage and diagnose memory leaks in Node.js applications.

#### Skills
The engineer can debug more complex applications using interactive debugging tools, effectively managing breakpoints and handling asynchronous debugging scenarios.

### ðŸŒ³ Advanced
At this level, the engineer is well-versed in advanced debugging techniques, including performance profiling and diagnosing complex issues in production environments.

- **Profiling Performance:** Proficiency in using performance profiling tools like the Node.js `--prof` flag and Chrome DevTools to analyze CPU usage and performance bottlenecks in applications.
- **Heap Snapshots and Memory Leaks:** Experience in taking heap snapshots to track down memory leaks and analyzing memory allocation using `heapdump` and other memory analysis tools.
- **Debugging in Production:** Familiarity with remote debugging and logging in production environments, using tools like `pm2` and distributed logging systems to track down and fix issues in live applications without downtime.

#### Skills
The engineer can debug production-level applications, optimize performance through CPU and memory profiling, and identify critical bottlenecks and memory leaks.

### ðŸš€ Expert
An expert in debugging can handle sophisticated debugging challenges, working across distributed systems, large-scale applications, and production environments with high reliability.

- **Advanced Performance Optimization:** Mastery in using profiling tools to fine-tune application performance, addressing CPU-bound tasks and event loop optimization.
- **Distributed Debugging:** Experience in debugging distributed systems and microservices, using advanced techniques like distributed tracing with tools such as Jaeger or OpenTelemetry to track requests across multiple services.
- **Custom Debugging Solutions:** Ability to build custom debugging solutions or integrate third-party monitoring and APM (Application Performance Management) tools like New Relic or Datadog for real-time performance tracking and error reporting.

#### Skills
The engineer can design and implement advanced debugging strategies for large-scale, distributed systems, ensuring that complex applications remain performant, stable, and resilient to bugs and errors.
