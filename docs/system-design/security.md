# System Design â€” **Security**

## Overview
Security in system design involves protecting systems, data, and resources from unauthorized access, attacks, and breaches. Robust security practices encompass identity management, data encryption, network security, and proactive monitoring to ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Mastering security enables engineers to design resilient systems that meet regulatory requirements and protect user data.

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At this level, engineers understand basic security principles and can implement foundational security measures.

- **Authentication and Authorization Basics:** Familiarity with user authentication (e.g., usernames and passwords) and authorization mechanisms (e.g., role-based access control).
- **Data Encryption Basics:** Understanding the basics of data encryption, such as SSL/TLS for securing data in transit.
- **Principles of Least Privilege:** Awareness of the principle of least privilege and applying it to restrict access based on necessity.

#### Skills
Engineers can set up basic authentication, use SSL/TLS for data encryption, and apply access control based on least privilege.

### ðŸŒ¿ Intermediate
At this level, engineers can implement advanced security measures for secure user access, data protection, and secure network configurations.

- **Token-Based Authentication:** Knowledge of using token-based authentication methods, such as OAuth2 and JWT, for secure, stateless access control.
- **Data Encryption at Rest and in Transit:** Ability to implement encryption for data at rest and in transit to protect sensitive information.
- **Network Security Configurations:** Proficiency in configuring network security groups, firewalls, and VPNs to secure data flows within cloud environments.
- **Security Logging and Monitoring:** Familiarity with logging security events and monitoring for suspicious activity to detect and respond to potential threats.

#### Skills
Engineers can implement token-based authentication, use encryption for data protection, configure secure networks, and log security events for monitoring.

### ðŸŒ³ Advanced
At this advanced level, engineers are proficient in designing security architectures and implementing proactive security measures for high-stakes applications.

- **Advanced Identity and Access Management (IAM):** Proficiency in configuring IAM policies, role-based access control (RBAC), and multi-factor authentication (MFA) for enhanced security.
- **Application Security Practices:** Knowledge of application security practices such as input validation, anti-CSRF measures, and secure handling of sensitive data.
- **Vulnerability Scanning and Management:** Ability to integrate automated vulnerability scanning and remediation processes into the development lifecycle.
- **Compliance and Data Protection Standards:** Understanding of compliance requirements (e.g., GDPR, HIPAA) and implementing data protection practices to meet regulatory standards.

#### Skills
Engineers can design secure IAM configurations, apply application security best practices, manage vulnerabilities proactively, and ensure regulatory compliance.

### ðŸš€ Expert
An expert in Security can design and manage comprehensive security strategies for large-scale, mission-critical systems, ensuring protection from evolving threats.

- **Zero Trust Architecture Implementation:** Expertise in implementing Zero Trust security models that require continuous authentication and authorization across network boundaries.
- **Advanced Threat Detection and Response:** Proficiency in setting up advanced threat detection using tools like intrusion detection systems (IDS) and automated incident response workflows.
- **Data Governance and Encryption Key Management:** Experience in managing data governance and secure encryption key management (e.g., AWS KMS) for large-scale applications.
- **Security Audits and Penetration Testing:** Ability to conduct regular security audits, perform penetration testing, and implement remediation strategies for identified vulnerabilities.
- **Security in CI/CD Pipelines:** Knowledge of embedding security into CI/CD pipelines with practices like static code analysis, dependency scanning, and compliance checks.

#### Skills
Engineers can implement Zero Trust architectures, manage threat detection and response, handle data governance, perform regular security audits, and integrate security into CI/CD pipelines for continuous protection.
