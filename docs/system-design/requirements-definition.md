# System Design â€” **Requirements Definition**

## Overview
Requirements Definition is the process of gathering and defining what a system needs to do, encompassing both functional and non-functional requirements. This initial step in system design lays the foundation for all further architectural and design decisions, ensuring the system aligns with business objectives, user needs, and technical constraints.

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At this level, engineers understand the basics of requirements gathering and can document simple functional requirements.

- **Basic Requirement Gathering:** Familiarity with gathering basic functional requirements by consulting stakeholders or interpreting project documentation.
- **Understanding Functional vs. Non-Functional Requirements:** Ability to distinguish between functional (what the system should do) and non-functional requirements (how the system should perform).
- **Use Case Documentation:** Knowledge of documenting basic use cases and user stories to represent system functionality from an end-user perspective.

#### Skills
Engineers can identify basic functional requirements, document use cases, and understand the distinction between functional and non-functional requirements.

### ðŸŒ¿ Intermediate
At this level, engineers can work with stakeholders to refine requirements and document detailed system specifications.

- **Stakeholder Communication:** Ability to communicate with various stakeholders (e.g., product managers, end-users) to refine requirements and address ambiguities.
- **Prioritization Techniques:** Knowledge of techniques like MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won't-have) to prioritize requirements based on business needs and constraints.
- **Defining Acceptance Criteria:** Familiarity with defining clear acceptance criteria for requirements to ensure they are testable and meet user expectations.

#### Skills
Engineers can refine and prioritize requirements, communicate effectively with stakeholders, and establish acceptance criteria for clear, testable outcomes.

### ðŸŒ³ Advanced
At this advanced level, engineers are proficient in gathering comprehensive requirements and can identify technical and business constraints.

- **Non-Functional Requirements Definition:** Expertise in defining non-functional requirements (e.g., scalability, security, availability) and understanding their impact on system design.
- **Requirements Trade-Off Analysis:** Ability to perform trade-off analysis to balance competing requirements, such as performance vs. cost or security vs. usability.
- **Documenting Requirements in Detail:** Proficiency in creating detailed requirements documentation, including workflows, system interactions, and technical specifications.

#### Skills
Engineers can define and document comprehensive requirements, perform trade-off analysis, and align requirements with technical and business constraints.

### ðŸš€ Expert
An expert in Requirements Definition can lead the requirements gathering process, ensuring alignment with business goals and long-term scalability.

- **Requirements Lifecycle Management:** Expertise in managing the requirements lifecycle, including tracking changes, versioning, and adapting requirements as the project evolves.
- **Strategic Alignment with Business Objectives:** Ability to align system requirements with long-term business goals, customer needs, and future scalability considerations.
- **Cross-Functional Requirements Gathering:** Proficiency in collaborating across multiple teams (e.g., legal, compliance, marketing) to ensure all requirements are met and compliant with standards.

#### Skills
Engineers can manage complex requirements across the project lifecycle, align them with strategic business goals, and lead cross-functional requirements gathering for comprehensive and future-proof designs.
