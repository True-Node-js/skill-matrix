# System Design â€” **Documentation**

## Overview
Documentation is essential for maintaining clarity, consistency, and knowledge sharing within a system. Comprehensive documentation supports onboarding, troubleshooting, and future development. Well-structured documentation includes design, architecture, API references, operational procedures, and user guides, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and work with the system.
