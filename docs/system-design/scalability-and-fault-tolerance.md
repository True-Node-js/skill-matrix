# System Design â€” **Scalability and Fault Tolerance**

## Overview
Scalability and fault tolerance are essential in designing systems that can handle growing workloads and maintain availability during failures. Scalability enables systems to grow with increasing demands, while fault tolerance ensures resilience and recovery from failures, maintaining uninterrupted service for users.
