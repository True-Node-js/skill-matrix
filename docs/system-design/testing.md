# System Design â€” **Testing**

## Overview
Testing in system design ensures that a system functions as expected, is resilient, and meets quality standards. A comprehensive testing strategy includes various testing types (unit, integration, end-to-end), automated testing, and CI/CD integration to deliver reliable and high-quality applications. Mastering testing allows engineers to prevent defects, improve maintainability, and optimize performance across complex systems.

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At this level, engineers understand basic testing principles and can write simple tests for individual components.

- **Unit Testing Basics:** Knowledge of unit testing to verify the functionality of individual components using testing frameworks (e.g., Mocha, Jest).
- **Basic Test Coverage:** Awareness of test coverage as a metric for evaluating how much of the codebase is tested.
- **Manual Testing:** Ability to conduct basic manual testing for verifying simple application workflows and identifying obvious issues.

#### Skills
Engineers can write basic unit tests, understand test coverage, and perform manual testing to verify simple functionality.

### ðŸŒ¿ Intermediate
At this level, engineers can write more complex tests, work with different testing types, and use automation tools.

- **Integration Testing:** Ability to implement integration tests that verify interactions between multiple components or services within the system.
- **End-to-End (E2E) Testing:** Knowledge of setting up end-to-end tests to simulate real user workflows and test the system as a whole.
- **Automated Testing in CI/CD Pipelines:** Familiarity with integrating automated tests into CI/CD pipelines to catch issues early in the deployment process.
- **Mocking and Stubbing:** Proficiency in using mocks and stubs to isolate parts of the application for focused testing.

#### Skills
Engineers can write integration and end-to-end tests, implement automated testing in CI/CD, and use mocking techniques for isolated testing.

### ðŸŒ³ Advanced
At this advanced level, engineers are proficient in designing and managing comprehensive test strategies, covering edge cases and performance.

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD):** Knowledge of TDD practices, where tests are written before code, ensuring better test coverage and code quality.
- **Performance and Load Testing:** Ability to conduct performance and load tests to evaluate system responsiveness under heavy usage.
- **Security and Compliance Testing:** Proficiency in implementing security tests to identify vulnerabilities and ensure compliance with regulatory standards.
- **Test Data Management:** Experience in managing test data effectively, including generating and anonymizing data for testing purposes.

#### Skills
Engineers can develop test-driven code, conduct load and security tests, and manage test data to ensure comprehensive and compliant testing.

### ðŸš€ Expert
An expert in Testing can design and manage enterprise-grade testing strategies, ensuring coverage, reliability, and maintainability at scale.

- **Behavior-Driven Development (BDD):** Expertise in BDD practices, defining test scenarios with business stakeholders using frameworks like Cucumber for shared understanding.
- **Continuous Testing and Monitoring:** Knowledge of continuous testing, with monitoring tools in place to validate system behavior and performance in production environments.
- **Automated Testing for Microservices and Distributed Systems:** Proficiency in testing microservices and distributed systems, including contract testing to verify service interactions.
- **Advanced Test Automation Frameworks:** Experience in designing custom test automation frameworks that support parallel and cross-platform testing.
- **Regression Testing and Automated Maintenance:** Ability to conduct regression tests regularly and automate the maintenance of test cases to keep them relevant as the system evolves.

#### Skills
Engineers can design advanced testing strategies with BDD, automate testing for microservices, implement continuous testing and monitoring, and ensure system-wide reliability and maintainability.
