# Node.js Development Tools â€” **NVM (Node Version Manager)**

## Overview
NVM (Node Version Manager) is a tool that allows engineers to manage multiple versions of Node.js on a single machine. This is useful when working on projects that require different versions of Node.js, allowing seamless switching between versions without conflicts. NVM simplifies managing project environments, improving development efficiency and ensuring compatibility with various project dependencies.

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At this stage, the engineer is introduced to the basics of NVM and how to use it to manage Node.js versions efficiently.

- **Installing NVM:** Understanding how to install NVM using a simple shell script or package manager, depending on the operating system.
- **Installing Node.js Versions:** Ability to install specific Node.js versions using `nvm install <version>`, enabling the use of different versions of Node.js.
- **Switching Node Versions:** Knowledge of switching between installed Node.js versions with the `nvm use <version>` command, facilitating easy version control for different projects.

#### Skills
The engineer can install, manage, and switch between different Node.js versions, ensuring that projects run on the correct version of Node.js without conflicts.

---

### ðŸŒ¿ Intermediate
As the engineer gains more experience with NVM, they learn to manage more complex scenarios, such as handling multiple projects with different Node.js requirements.

- **Listing Installed Versions:** Ability to list installed Node.js versions with `nvm list`, providing a clear view of the available versions on the system.
- **Setting Default Node Version:** Understanding how to set a default Node.js version globally using `nvm alias default <version>`, ensuring that the specified version is used by default when opening a terminal.
- **Automatic Version Switching:** Knowledge of creating an `.nvmrc` file in a projectâ€™s root directory to specify the required Node.js version, allowing NVM to automatically switch versions when navigating into that projectâ€™s directory.

#### Skills
The engineer can efficiently manage multiple Node.js versions across different projects and set up project-specific configurations to automate version switching.

---

### ðŸŒ³ Advanced
At this level, the engineer can handle complex Node.js versioning setups and use NVM to optimize the development environment for larger or multiple teams.

- **Using Different Versions Concurrently:** Proficiency in running different versions of Node.js in separate terminal sessions or containers, allowing for simultaneous work on projects with conflicting version requirements.
- **Managing LTS and Stable Versions:** Ability to handle Long-Term Support (LTS) and stable Node.js versions effectively, ensuring that critical production environments use the most appropriate version.
- **Scripting with NVM:** Familiarity with automating Node.js version management by scripting NVM commands into build or deployment pipelines, improving CI/CD processes.

#### Skills
The engineer can manage complex environments with multiple Node.js versions and integrate NVM into development workflows, ensuring efficiency and consistency across projects.

---

### ðŸš€ Expert
An expert in NVM can configure and optimize Node.js version management across large-scale projects, ensuring seamless collaboration and deployment workflows.

- **Enterprise Node.js Management:** Expertise in managing Node.js versions across multiple development and production environments, using NVM to standardize versioning practices across teams and organizations.
- **Optimizing CI/CD Pipelines with NVM:** Mastery in integrating NVM into CI/CD pipelines to automate version switching and ensure compatibility with different environments, reducing human error and improving deployment consistency.
- **Cross-Platform Version Management:** Ability to ensure consistent Node.js version management across different platforms (macOS, Linux, Windows Subsystem for Linux), ensuring smooth collaboration in cross-platform development teams.

#### Skills
The engineer can design and implement large-scale Node.js version management systems using NVM, ensuring version consistency, efficient workflows, and seamless cross-platform compatibility.
