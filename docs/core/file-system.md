# Node.js Core â€” **File System**

## Overview
The File System module in Node.js provides an API for interacting with the file system, allowing engineers to read and write files, manipulate directories, and manage file permissions. Understanding the file system is essential for developing applications that need to store and retrieve data, perform logging, or manipulate files on the server. Mastery of this module enables engineers to build efficient data-driven applications and manage file operations effectively.

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At this stage, the engineer becomes familiar with basic file system operations. They learn how to perform simple read and write tasks and understand the fundamental concepts of file handling.

- **fs.readFile:** Ability to read the contents of a file asynchronously, handling potential errors and understanding the callback pattern.
- **fs.writeFile:** Understanding how to create or overwrite a file with new data, using asynchronous methods for non-blocking operations.
- **fs.appendFile:** Knowledge of how to add data to an existing file without removing its current contents.
- **fs.stat:** Basic understanding of retrieving information about a file, such as its size and modification date.

#### Skills
The engineer can perform basic file operations, laying the foundation for more complex file handling scenarios and demonstrating an understanding of asynchronous programming concepts.
