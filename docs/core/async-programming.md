# Node.js Core â€” **Async Programming**

## Overview
Asynchronous programming is a core feature of Node.js that enables non-blocking I/O operations, allowing developers to write efficient, scalable applications. Understanding asynchronous patterns is crucial for handling operations like file reading, database queries, and API requests without freezing the event loop.

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At the novice level, the developer should understand the basics of asynchronous programming in Node.js and be able to work with simple async patterns.

- **Callbacks**: Knowledge of callback functions and how they are used in asynchronous operations.
- **Basic async flow**: Understanding how to structure code to handle asynchronous events and operations.
  
#### Skills
- Writing simple asynchronous functions using callbacks.
- Recognizing the importance of asynchronous behavior in Node.js.

---

### ðŸŒ¿ Intermediate
At this level, the developer should be familiar with more advanced asynchronous programming techniques and be able to manage multiple asynchronous operations effectively.

- **Promises**: Understanding how to create and use promises for managing asynchronous operations.
- **Chaining promises**: Ability to chain multiple promises for sequential execution of async tasks.
- **Error handling**: Implementing error handling with promises to manage failures gracefully.

#### Skills
- Creating complex async flows using promises.
- Understanding the differences between callback-based and promise-based approaches.

---

### ðŸŒ³ Advanced
At this level, the developer has a strong grasp of asynchronous programming patterns and can implement advanced features for managing async operations.

- **Async/Await**: Mastery of the async/await syntax for writing cleaner and more readable asynchronous code.
- **Concurrency**: Understanding how to manage concurrent asynchronous operations, including techniques like `Promise.all` and `Promise.race`.
- **Event loop**: Deep understanding of the Node.js event loop and how it handles asynchronous operations.

#### Skills
- Utilizing async/await for complex asynchronous flows.
- Implementing advanced concurrency patterns to optimize performance.
