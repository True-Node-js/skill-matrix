# Node.js Core â€” **Buffers**

## Overview
Buffers are a crucial part of Node.js that allows engineers to work with binary data directly. A Buffer is essentially a chunk of memory that can be used to store raw binary data, which is particularly useful when dealing with streams, file I/O, or any binary data manipulation. Understanding buffers is essential for efficient data handling in applications that require performance optimization and low-level data processing.
