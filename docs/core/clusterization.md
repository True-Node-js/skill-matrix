# Node.js Core â€” **Clusterization**

## Overview
Clusterization in Node.js allows for running multiple instances of a Node.js application across several CPU cores, effectively distributing the workload. Node.js is single-threaded by design, but with the `cluster` module, it becomes possible to take full advantage of multi-core systems by running multiple worker processes. This technique is crucial for improving scalability and enhancing performance, particularly for CPU-bound tasks.
