# Node.js Core â€” **CLI (Command Line Interface)**

## Overview
Node.js applications can be interacted with and managed through a command line interface (CLI). The Node.js CLI allows engineers to create tools that accept input from the terminal, automate tasks, and manipulate application behavior based on the commands given. Understanding how to build and use CLI applications is essential for engineers who want to create efficient developer tools, automate workflows, or handle complex server-side processes from the command line.

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At this stage, the engineer becomes familiar with basic CLI operations in Node.js, learning how to accept input and output data to the terminal.

- **Accessing Command Line Arguments:** Understanding how to access command line arguments using the `process.argv` array to handle user inputs.
- **Basic Input and Output:** Using `console.log()` to output results to the terminal and `process.stdin` to read input from the command line interactively.
- **Exiting the Application:** Knowledge of how to properly terminate Node.js applications with `process.exit()` and understand exit codes.

#### Skills
The engineer can create basic CLI applications that accept input and provide output, enabling simple command line interactions with Node.js programs.

### ðŸŒ¿ Intermediate
As the engineer progresses, they learn to build more sophisticated CLI tools, incorporating command parsing, advanced argument handling, and interactive features.

- **Argument Parsing:** Ability to parse and handle multiple command line arguments using libraries like `minimist` or `yargs` to create more user-friendly CLI interfaces.
- **Interactive CLIs:** Familiarity with building interactive command line applications using `readline` or `inquirer.js`, allowing users to provide input in real time.
- **Environment Variables:** Understanding how to use and manage environment variables (`process.env`) within CLI applications to configure behavior without modifying code directly.

#### Skills
The engineer can build interactive and flexible CLI tools that handle complex argument parsing and provide dynamic user experiences on the command line.

### ðŸŒ³ Advanced
At this level, the engineer has a comprehensive understanding of creating optimized, feature-rich CLI applications that handle advanced user interactions and workflows.

- **Custom Command Handlers:** Proficiency in implementing custom command handlers, enabling the CLI application to offer multiple commands, subcommands, and flags.
- **Error Handling in CLI Applications:** Expertise in implementing comprehensive error handling, including custom error messages, validation of user input, and clear feedback in terminal output.
- **Automating Tasks:** Experience in building CLI tools that automate tasks like file generation, deployment, or managing services, improving developer workflows.

#### Skills
The engineer can design robust CLI tools that automate processes, handle complex command structures, and provide informative and user-friendly interfaces.
