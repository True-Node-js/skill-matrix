# Node.js Core â€” **Multithreading**

## Overview
Node.js is traditionally single-threaded due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture. However, with the introduction of the `worker_threads` module, developers can now utilize multithreading to execute tasks in parallel. This is particularly useful for CPU-intensive operations that can block the main thread, allowing developers to leverage multiple CPU cores for improved performance.
