# Client-Server Communication â€” **GraphQL**

## Overview
GraphQL is a query language for APIs and a runtime for executing queries, allowing clients to request specific data and reducing issues like over-fetching and under-fetching data. Developed by Facebook, GraphQL offers an efficient alternative to REST by enabling clients to retrieve exactly the data they need in a single request. Mastery of GraphQL empowers engineers to build flexible, performant, and client-focused APIs.

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At this level, engineers understand the basic concepts of GraphQL and can work with simple queries and mutations.

- **Basic Query and Mutation:** Familiarity with defining and executing basic GraphQL queries to retrieve data and mutations to modify server data.
- **GraphQL Schema Basics:** Understanding the basic structure of a GraphQL schema, including types, fields, and simple resolvers.
- **GraphQL vs. REST:** Awareness of key differences between GraphQL and REST, particularly in data fetching flexibility and client-driven queries.

#### Skills
Engineers can work with basic queries and mutations, define a simple GraphQL schema, and explain how GraphQL differs from REST in terms of data fetching.

### ðŸŒ¿ Intermediate
At this level, engineers can work with more complex schemas and effectively manage client-specific data needs with GraphQL.

- **Nested Queries and Aliases:** Proficiency in handling nested queries and using aliases to structure complex data requests.
- **Arguments and Variables:** Ability to use arguments in queries and mutations and define variables to create reusable and dynamic queries.
- **Error Handling:** Knowledge of handling errors within GraphQL responses and designing resilient APIs that return meaningful error messages.

#### Skills
Engineers can handle dynamic queries with arguments and variables, manage nested data structures, and build GraphQL APIs with effective error handling.

### ðŸŒ³ Advanced
At this advanced level, engineers are proficient in building optimized and secure GraphQL APIs, focusing on scalability and performance.

- **Fragments and Reusability:** Expertise in using fragments to organize and reuse parts of queries, making complex queries more efficient.
- **Pagination and Filtering:** Ability to implement pagination and filtering in GraphQL queries to ensure efficient data retrieval for large datasets.
- **Authentication and Authorization:** Knowledge of implementing secure GraphQL APIs with JWT, OAuth, or other mechanisms to control access and protect data.

#### Skills
Engineers can build scalable GraphQL APIs, optimizing queries with fragments, handling large datasets with pagination, and implementing secure access controls.

### ðŸš€ Expert
An expert in GraphQL can architect enterprise-grade APIs with advanced features and optimizations, supporting complex client-server interactions.

- **GraphQL Subscriptions for Real-Time Data:** Ability to implement real-time data features using GraphQL subscriptions for notifications, live updates, and chat applications.
- **Performance Optimization and Caching:** Expertise in optimizing GraphQL APIs through data loaders, caching strategies, and managing the N+1 query problem.
- **Schema Stitching and Federation:** Knowledge of schema stitching and federated schemas to integrate multiple GraphQL services into a single unified API for distributed architectures.

#### Skills
Engineers can design large-scale GraphQL architectures with real-time data support, advanced caching, and federation for highly performant, flexible applications.
