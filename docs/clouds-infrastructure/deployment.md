# Clouds and Infrastructure â€” **Deployment**

## Overview
Deployment involves deploying, managing, and scaling applications across different environments, ensuring they run reliably and efficiently. Knowledge of deployment practices and tools (such as AWS Elastic Beanstalk, Kubernetes, or Docker Swarm) enables engineers to automate and streamline application deployment, making them repeatable, scalable, and resilient.

---

### ðŸŒ± Novice
At this level, engineers understand the basics of application deployment and can perform simple deployments manually.

- **Basic Deployment Concepts:** Understanding deployment fundamentals and key terms, including environments (e.g., dev, staging, prod), continuous deployment, and blue-green deployments.
- **Manual Deployments:** Ability to deploy applications manually using tools like SCP, FTP, or basic cloud interfaces (e.g., AWS Console).
- **Basic Rollbacks:** Familiarity with manual rollback processes for handling failed deployments.

#### Skills
Engineers can perform manual deployments, understand deployment environments, and implement basic rollback processes.

---

### ðŸŒ¿ Intermediate
At this level, engineers can automate deployment processes and handle more complex deployment scenarios.

- **Automated Deployments:** Familiarity with CI/CD tools (e.g., Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, GitHub Actions) to set up automated deployment pipelines.
- **Rolling Updates and Canary Deployments:** Ability to perform rolling updates and canary deployments to reduce risk during updates by gradually rolling out changes.
- **Basic Configuration Management:** Knowledge of configuration management tools (e.g., Ansible, Chef) for managing application configuration consistency across environments.

#### Skills
Engineers can set up automated deployments, manage rolling and canary deployments, and use configuration management tools for consistent deployments across environments.

---

### ðŸŒ³ Advanced
At this advanced level, engineers are proficient in managing complex, large-scale deployments with high availability and scalability.

- **Immutable Infrastructure Deployment:** Experience with deploying immutable infrastructure using containers or VMs, ensuring clean environments for every deployment.
- **Advanced Rollback Strategies:** Expertise in automated rollback strategies for high-availability applications, minimizing downtime in case of deployment failure.
- **Container Orchestration for Deployment:** Proficiency in deploying applications in containerized environments using orchestration tools like Kubernetes or AWS ECS, ensuring scalability and fault tolerance.

#### Skills
Engineers can design scalable, fault-tolerant deployment systems, leveraging container orchestration, immutable infrastructure, and robust rollback strategies.

### ðŸš€ Expert
An expert in Deployment can design and manage enterprise-grade deployment pipelines, ensuring security, scalability, resilience, and compliance for complex applications.

- **Advanced CI/CD Pipeline Design:** Expertise in building highly automated CI/CD pipelines with multi-step approvals, parallel testing, and environment-based configurations.
- **Infrastructure Deployment Across Multiple Regions:** Proficiency in deploying infrastructure across multiple geographic regions to support global applications and ensure high availability.
- **Zero-Downtime Deployments:** Knowledge of implementing zero-downtime deployments using advanced strategies such as blue-green deployments, feature flags, and traffic routing.
- **Security and Compliance in Deployment Pipelines:** Ability to embed security and compliance checks into deployment pipelines, including automated vulnerability scanning and auditing.
- **Disaster Recovery and Failover Planning:** Experience in designing deployment strategies that support disaster recovery and failover to backup environments or regions.

#### Skills
Engineers can build enterprise-scale deployment pipelines with zero-downtime deployments, multi-region infrastructure, disaster recovery support, and comprehensive security and compliance practices.
