# Clouds and Infrastructure â€” **Monitoring**

## Overview
Monitoring involves tracking and analyzing the performance, health, and availability of applications and infrastructure. Effective monitoring enables engineers to detect issues, optimize performance, and ensure reliability. Advanced monitoring practices also support proactive alerting, diagnostics, and automated responses, essential for maintaining high-performance, scalable systems.
